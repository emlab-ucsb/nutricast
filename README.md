This repository contains all data and code for the Nutricast tool (https://emlab-ucsb.shinyapps.io/nutricast/) which is a web-based tool to explore forecasted nutritional gains from marine fisheries and mariculture reforms under climate change.

This web application is largely powered using data from the following four papers:
